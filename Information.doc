In this file you can find out what I did in this routing and routing categories simple Laravel project ;
  
  1) I changed the name of bar itself to be "Beshoy Mourad" instead of "Laravel".
  2) Routing /about to welcome you by "Welcome George".
  3) Routing /store to be able to change the messages ( I make it as store and products for men or women or anything).
  3.1) Using "if" to avoid not entering any string by making a default state.
  3.2) Using strip_tags to stop hackers scripts ( Security inhancements).
  4) Routing /coffee_shop with category and item parameters.
  4.1) putting "?" after a parameter to make adding parameters optional.
  4.2) putting parameters=null is to avoid "too few arguments" error.
  4.3) Using "if" to avoid not entering any value for the parameters by making a default state.
